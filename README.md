# An AI Agent for Pentago-Twist

An AI agent for Pentago-Twist, a game modified from Pentago. This serves as the final project for COMP 424 (Artificial Intelligence) at McGill University.

The difference between Pentago-Twist and Pentago is that in Pentago-Twist, after placing a piece, the player has to choose a quadrant to rotate 90 degrees clockwise or flip horizontally, instead of rotate 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in Pentago.

This agent applies alpha-beta pruning and MCTS in alternate rounds to make moves. The value function of a board state is hand-crafted.
